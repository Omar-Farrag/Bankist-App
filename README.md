The user can deposit, withdraw, and transfer money to other accounts. There is also the option to permanently delete
an account.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of an Online Course on Udemy titled
**_The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!_** The game's
user interface and rules were both designed by the course instructor, **Jonas Schmedtmann**, and
students had to implement the game's logic using Javascript. Still, Jonas guided students all the
way through the implementation by providing walkthrough videos. Therefore, I would like to thank
Jonas for his tremendous commitment to his students and for giving us this great project.
